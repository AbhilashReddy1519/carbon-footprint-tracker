                    <p>
                        For those who fly (frequently or otherwise) the big
                        question to ask is “Do I need to fly?”, followed by “Is
                        there another way I can get where I want to go?”
                        Reducing the number of flights we take, or not flying at
                        all, is the number one way of shrinking our carbon
                        footprint. This applies equally to personal flying and
                        business miles – although we may have less control over
                        our business travel.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This is always going to be a hard area to deal with,
                        particularly if we are travelling to see family and
                        friends – what some people call “love miles”. Skype and
                        other online video conferencing services are a poor
                        substitute – but may be good alternatives in some
                        situations.

                    <p>
                        The best way to get about is under our own steam –
                        walking or cycling are great for local journeys, keeping
                        you fit and healthy, connected with your neighbours,
                        saving money and often time too. For longer journeys,
                        public transport is best (look for journey planning
                        websites to find the best way of linking bus and train
                        journeys). Lift sharing can also save you money as well
                        as cutting your carbon footprint (look out for local and
                        national liftshare websites).

                    <p>
                        Although car sharing takes a certain amount of
                        organisation and isn’t always 100% convenient the
                        reality for many of us is that often our car simply sits
                        outside our house or place of work. But if it’s not
                        being used then what’s the problem? The first is that
                        when it’s there we do tend to use it – even to just pop
                        down to the shops, the second is that manufacturing a
                        car has a carbon footprint – the more cars the more
                        emissions.

                    <p>
                        One of the “small wins” for our carbon footprint at home
                        can be changing to LED lightbulbs. It won’t make a huge
                        impact on our footprint but it is easy to do and the
                        result is noticeable on our electricity bill. The same
                        goes for turning off appliances rather than leaving them
                        on standby.

                    <p>
                        A “big win” at home would come from changing energy
                        supplier. There are now a growing number of companies
                        that offer electricity from renewable sources. Some also
                        offer renewable natural gas though it’s worth checking
                        how they’re producing the gas.

                    <p>
                        Our food accounts, on average, for between 20% and 30%
                        of our annual carbon footprint. This is due to its
                        manufacture and transport – from field to plate.
                        Research from the University of Oxford estimates the
                        footprints of different diets.

                    <p>
                        Many of us already eat more than the “high meat-eaters”,
                        so simply reducing the amount of meat (particularly red
                        meat) that we eat will have a significant impact on our
                        footprint (not to mention our pocket, and maybe our
                        waistline…). Our carbon calculator allows you to “mix
                        and match” the different categories for each week.

                    <h2>Waste & Recycling</h2>
                    <p>
                        As a proportion of our carbon footprint waste and
                        recycling is the smallest part. Here we have to think
                        more widely than just our carbon footprint. For most of
                        us, producing less waste and recycling more will have
                        only a small impact on our footprint. However, there are
                        many other environmental benefits from cutting down on
                        our waste – less waste goes to landfill, reduces demand
                        on finite resources, saves money – both for us and
                        council waste management budgets – so, the more we can
                        do the better. Producing less waste means that we will
                        probably be consuming less which will have its own
                        effects further back up the carbon footprint chain.

                        In many areas, provision for recycling is good and
                        getting better. In other areas, it is more difficult to
                        recycle a wide variety of materials (different plastics
                        being one example), which leads on to the next section…
                        Government and services.

                        it’s outside of our control. We have very little direct
                        input into the carbon footprint of the services that our
                        government provides. We can, however, get involved at
                        the local, county, state and national levels to
                        influence policy on environmental and climate change
