                Our carbon calculator is easy to use — and it will deliver your
                total estimated personal carbon emissions about as accurately as
                many hours of data-gathering and fact-finding.
            </p>
            <p>
                As with any online carbon calculator, ours includes a margin of
                error due to the difficulty and imprecision inherent in
                measuring the carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) output of your
                morning commute or your dietary decisions. We combine the best
                available data and a range of informed assumptions to form the
                basis of our calculations and to provide you an emissions
                estimate you can rely on — and begin to neutralise.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because this is a personal carbon calculator, it does not
                account for emissions related to commercial or industrial energy
                or transportation. Our focus is on those everyday variables you
                can influence the most — namely, your residential energy,
                personal travel and food-related emissions.
            </p>
            <p>
                To avoid confusion, we express greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
                figures in CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e), where 1
                metric ton of carbon = 3.67 metric ton of carbon dioxide.
